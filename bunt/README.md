# About this script #

**bunt** (*German: colourful*) is a script to
**bu**ild a **n**ew **t**heme.

I am planning to add more functionality later on.
~~If you're planning on using this script you will probably need
to make some minor adjustments as it is referencing a Dropbox/Wallpaper
directory.~~

This is no longer true, the current wallpaper is now stored in the bunt
directory.

To be brutally honest I'm just writing this readme because
I thought the name was really clever.
